	    <h2 id="mother">Mother</h2>
	    <p>Misty is a mother of three boys and one girl.  If you asked her what her favorite job is or ever has been, she would tell you
		that it is being a mother.  While handling a pack of four can be stressful, Misty enjoys watching her children learn and play.  She takes great pride and receives much pleasure from teaching them as well, even though it can be tough juggling four different personalities. </p>
